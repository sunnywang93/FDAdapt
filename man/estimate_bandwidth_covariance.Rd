\arguments{
\item{curves}{List, where each element represents a curve. Each curve
must be a list with two entries:
\itemize{
\item $t Sampling points.
\item $x Observed points.
}}

\item{grid_bandwidth}{Grid of points to estimate bandwidth.}

\item{grid_smooth}{Grid of points to smooth curves.}

\item{k0}{Minimum number of points curves must possess to be used in
estimation.}

\item{grid_param}{Grid of points to estimate parameters.}

\item{sigma}{Noise level, if known. Defaults to NULL, which estimates it.}

\item{mu0}{Density lower bound for time points. Defaults to NULL, which
estimates it.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements, containing
\itemize{
\item A matrix of bandwidth for every point \verb{(t,s)}.
\item A list, containing
\itemize{
\item \strong{$moments} Estimated moments.
\item \strong{$constants} Estimated HÃ¶lder constants \code{H(t)} and \code{L(t)}.
\item \strong{$kernel-int} Integrated constant of kernel.
\item \strong{$N_gamma_ts} Harmonic mean of the number of points used for
smoothing each curve at \code{(t|s)}.
\item \strong{$N_gamma_st} Harmonic mean of the number of points used for
smoothing each curve at \code{(s|t)}.
\item \strong{$WN} Total number of curves selected for estimation.

\description{
\code{estimate_bandwidth_covariance} estimates the bandwidth at every point
\verb{(t,s)} that is used to smooth each curve for the purpose of
covariance function estimation.
