\title{Estimate covariance function using adaptive global bandwidth}
\usage{
covariance_norm(curves, grid_bandwidth, grid_smooth, k0, params)
}
\arguments{
\item{curves}{List, where each element represents a curve. Each curve
must be a list with two entries:
\itemize{
\item $t Sampling points.
\item $x Observed points.
}}

\item{grid_bandwidth}{Grid of points to estimate bandwidth.}

\item{grid_smooth}{Grid of points to smooth curves.}

\item{k0}{Minimum number of points curves must possess to be used in
estimation.}

\item{grid_param}{Grid of points to estimate parameters.}

\item{sigma}{Noise level, if known. Defaults to NULL, which estimates it.}

\item{mu0}{Density lower bound for time points. Defaults to NULL, which
estimates it.}
}
\value{
A list containing
\itemize{
\item \strong{$cov} Estimated covariance function.
\item \strong{$bandwidth} Global bandwidth used to smooth each curve.
\item \strong{$constants} Tibble containing HÃ¶lder constants.
\item \strong{$kernel_int} Integrated kernel.
\item \strong{$Ngamma_ts} Harmonic mean of the number of points used to smooth
each curve at \code{t|s}.
\item \strong{$Ngamma_st} Transpose of \code{Ngamma_ts}.
\item \strong{$WN} Total number of points selected for estimation.
}

\description{
\code{covariance_norm} estimates the covariance function using curves that
have been smoothed using an adaptive global bandwidth.
